I have a deep passion for both coding and art, as they allow me to express my creativity in unique ways.
 I love coding because it challenges me to think logically and solve problems while bringing my ideas to life through technology.
  On the other hand, I enjoy art because it helps me explore my imagination and express emotions visually. Combining these two hobbies I design and create projects that are both functional and visually appealing. 
My aim is to become a software engineer in the future, where I can use my creativity and technical 
skills to develop innovative apps and programs that make life easier, smarter, and more enjoyable for people around the world.

My biggest inspiration in life comes from my parents. They are the reason behind everything I have achieved and everything I hope to become. Their constant love, support, and encouragement motivate me to give my best in everything I do. I have seen how hard they work every day to give me a good education and a better future, and that always reminds me to stay dedicated and focused on my goals. Whenever I face difficulties or feel discouraged, I think about their sacrifices and it gives me the strength to keep going. They have taught me the values of honesty, kindness, and perseverance, which guide me in every step of my life. My parents are not only my biggest supporters but also my greatest teachers, and I aim to make them proud by working hard to achieve my dreams and become a successful person in the future.

I have earned several awards and trophies for my active participation and excellent performance in both academics and extracurricular activities. I received medals and certificates from Sunrise English Boarding School and Shivraj Municipality for my dedication, hard work, and achievements in various school-level competitions. Some of my proudest moments include securing First Position in Class Six, Second Position in Secondary Level, and winning multiple ECA medals for outstanding participation. These achievements motivate me to keep improving myself, work harder, and stay determined toward my goal of becoming a successful software engineer in the future.

Art has always been one of my favorite ways to express creativity and emotions.
 I enjoy spending my free time drawing and creating artworks that reflect my thoughts, imagination, and the beauty of the world around me.
  Each piece of art I create holds a special meaning and helps me improve my creativity and focus. 
  These two artworks are examples of my love for art and my effort to keep learning and experimenting with new ideas, colors, and styles. Art not only relaxes my mind but also inspires me to think creatively — a skill that also helps me in coding and problem-solving.
